# Poe Creator Documentation

## Docs
- [Accessing other bots on Poe](https://creator.poe.com/docs/accessing-other-bots-on-poe): The Poe bot query API allows creators to invoke other bots on Poe (which includes bots created by Poe like GPT-3.5-Turbo and Claude-Instant and bots created by other creators) and this access is provided for free so that creators do not have to worry about LLM costs. For every user message, server bot creators get to make up to ten calls to another bot of their choice.
- [Best practices for image generation prompts](https://creator.poe.com/docs/best-practices-image-generation-bots): You can build image generation prompt bots on top of several available models, including:
- [Best practices for text generation prompts](https://creator.poe.com/docs/best-practice-text-generation): The prompt that you write as part ofprompt bot creationis passed to the underlying model as a system message. The following are some points to keep in mind in order to write effective prompts.
- [Best practices for video generation prompts](https://creator.poe.com/docs/best-practices-for-video-generation-prompts): Style, camera angle, description of character/ scene + verb (doing something) + background/ environment/setting + any additional information
- [Canvas limitations](https://creator.poe.com/docs/canvas-limitations): Canvas apps are single-file HTML applications. They cannot run server-side code. Apart from loading resources from CDNs (seeFetching external resources), they generally cannot connect to external servers.
- [Creator Monetization](https://creator.poe.com/docs/creator-monetization): The creator monetization program lets Poe bot creators get paid. See program details on thecreator monetization program page. Check theCreators pagefor updates.
- [Enabling file upload for your bot](https://creator.poe.com/docs/enabling-file-upload-for-your-bot): The Poe API allows your bot to takes files as input. There are several settings designed to streamline the process of enabling file uploads for your bot:
- [Example bots](https://creator.poe.com/docs/examples): These bots are all server bots built on the API. You can try each of them live in Poe by clicking the link.
- [fastapi_poe: Python API Reference](https://creator.poe.com/docs/fastapi_poe-python-reference): The following is the API reference for thefastapi_poeclient library. The reference assumes that you usedimport fastapi_poe as fp.
- [Frequently asked questions](https://creator.poe.com/docs/frequently-asked-questions): Yes, you are welcome to monetize your bot through alternative means which include, but are not limited to, placing ads in your content or asking users to visit your website to make donations or payments.
- [Functional Guides](https://creator.poe.com/docs/server-bots-functional-guides): If you are just getting started with server bots, we recommend checking out ourquick startguide. The following guides provide examples of accomplishing specific things with your bot.
- [Fundraising](https://creator.poe.com/docs/fundraising): We maintain a list of investors who have told us they are interested in funding companies building AI products that are integrated into Poe as bots. This includes GPs at 8 top-tier Silicon Valley venture firms like Benchmark Capital and Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross. We have already assisted two companies that operate Poe bots in raising millions of dollars and hope to support many more.
- [How to contact us](https://creator.poe.com/docs/how-to-contact-us): Please join us onDiscord, or email us at[email protected]with any questions or feedback.
- [How to create a prompt bot](https://creator.poe.com/docs/how-to-create-a-prompt-bot): If you are using a web browser, go topoe.comand click on the "Create a bot" button in the left sidebar. Alternatively you can navigate directly topoe.com/create_bot. If you are using the Poe mobile app, tap the ≡ icon the top-left to open the sidebar and then tap on the "Create a bot" button at the top of the menu.
- [How to get distribution](https://creator.poe.com/docs/how-to-get-distribution): In order for a bot to be recommended to other users by Poe, it needs to have a profile picture and a description. You can edit these on the Edit bot screen. The more likely people are to use your bot and continue to use it over time, the more likely Poe will be to recommend it.
- [How we cover your costs](https://creator.poe.com/docs/how-we-cover-your-costs): Our intent is to cover all model inference costs and any other significant per-message costs involved in operating any bot on Poe. There are two ways this can happen at present:
- [Poe Creator Guide](https://creator.poe.com/docs/welcome-to-poe-for-creators): Poe is a platform for people to discover and use AI products created by many different companies and individuals. Anyone can create a bot on Poe.
- [Poe Embed API](https://creator.poe.com/docs/poe-embed-api): The Poe Embed API is used for connecting web applications embedded in Poe with the Poe environment.
- [Poe Protocol Specification](https://creator.poe.com/docs/poe-protocol-specification): Poeis a platform for interacting with AI-based bots. Poe provides access to popular chat bots like OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo and Anthropic's Claude, but also allows a creator to create their own bot by implementing the following protocol.
- [Quick Start](https://creator.poe.com/docs/canvas-app-quick-start): Canvas apps are interactive web applications hosted on Poe. Unlike chat-based bots, Canvas apps provide custom visual interfaces for any kind of interactive experience. They can interact with the Poe environment in various ways - including calling models on Poe and using their responses in the app - enabling creators to develop applications ranging from simple tools and games to advanced AI-powered experiences. And using theApp Creatorbot, anyone can bring their ideas to life just by describing them -no coding required.
- [Quick Start](https://creator.poe.com/docs/quick-start): In this quick start guide, we will build a bot server in Python and then integrate it with Poe. Once you have created a Poe bot powered by your server, any Poe user can interact with it. The following diagram might be useful in visualizing how your bot server fits into Poe.
- [Recommended bot settings](https://creator.poe.com/docs/recommended-bot-settings): There are various settings that can be applied to your bot. For the best user experience we recommend turning on the following settings for your bot:
- [Rendering an image in the response](https://creator.poe.com/docs/rendering-an-image-in-the-response): The Poe API allows you to embed images in your bot's response using Markdown syntax. The following is an example implementation describing a bot that returns a static response containing an image.
- [Setting an introduction message](https://creator.poe.com/docs/setting-an-introduction-message): The Poe API allows you to set a friendly introduction message for your bot, providing you with a way to instruct the users on how they should use the bot. In order to do so, you have to overrideget_settingsand set the parameter calledintroduction_messageto whatever you want that message to be.
- [Updating bot settings](https://creator.poe.com/docs/updating-bot-settings): The settings endpoint provides a way for you to opt in/out of Poe's features enabling you to customize the behavior of the bot. This article will describe how you can get Poe to fetch the latest settings from your bot.
