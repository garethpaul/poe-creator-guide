[Suggest Edits](/edit/fundraising)

We maintain a list of investors who have told us they are interested in funding companies building AI products that are integrated into Poe as bots. This includes GPs at 8 top-tier Silicon Valley venture firms like Benchmark Capital and Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross. We have already assisted two companies that operate Poe bots in raising millions of dollars and hope to support many more.

If you are a Poe creator with meaningful usage and you are raising money, at your request (and only with your permission) we will email the list and broker connections to any interested investors. Please reach out to us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5d39382b3831322d382f2e1d2d3238733e3230) if you'd like us to help.

If you are a venture firm or an angel investor and would like to join the list, please let us know at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#70141506151c1f0015020330001f155e131f1d).
